In answering these questions we must consider , in
the first place , the scene , and , in the second
place , the psychology of the two central
characters who for so long a time have been
regarded as the very embodiment of unchecked
passion . As to the scene , it must be remembered
that the egypt of those days was not egyptian as
we understand the word , but rather greek .
Cleopatra herself was of greek descent .
